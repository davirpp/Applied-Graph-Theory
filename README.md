# Applied Graph Theory

A Jupyter Notebook to practice the main concepts about Graphs, in [graphs.py](https://github.com/davirpp/Applied-Graph-Theory/blob/main/graphs.py) I put all the code in a class to simplify future uses and [instance.txt](https://github.com/davirpp/Applied-Graph-Theory/blob/main/instance.txt) is an example of a instance that can be read by the Graph class
